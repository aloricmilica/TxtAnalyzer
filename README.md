# Linguistic Metrics Analyzer - LMA
## Introduction
The purpose of this final project was creating a software library which calculates the linguistical metrics of a textual file, such as
the number of paraghraps, pronouns, negation, future etc. All in all, this application calculates all the metrics that can be calculated by Simple Natural Language Processing tool (SiNLP). The metrics which needed to be analyzed were determined based on the paper: *Crossley, S. A., Allen, L. K., Kyle, K., & McNamara, D.S. (2014). Analyzing discourse processing using a simple natural language processing tool (SiNLP). Discourse Processes, 51(5-6), pp. 511-534.2*. 

The project was written in Java programming language by using Stanford CoreNLP Java framework.
